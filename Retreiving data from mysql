o create a new database, run the following command from your MySQL console:

mysql> CREATE DATABASE `example_database`;
Now you can create a new user and grant him full privileges on the database you have just created.

The following command creates a new user named example_user, using mysql_native_password as default authentication method. We’re defining this user’s password as password, but you should replace this value with a secure password of your own choosing.

mysql>  CREATE USER 'example_user'@'%' IDENTIFIED WITH mysql_native_password BY 'password';
Now we need to give this user permission over the example_database database:

mysql> GRANT ALL ON example_database.* TO 'example_user'@'%';
This will give the example_user user full privileges over the example_database database, while preventing this user from creating or modifying other databases on your server.

Now exit the MySQL shell with:

mysql> exit
You can test if the new user has the proper permissions by logging in to the MySQL console again, this time using the custom user credentials:

mysql -u example_user -p
Notice the -p flag in this command, which will prompt you for the password used when creating the example_user user. After logging in to the MySQL console, confirm that you have access to the example_database database:

mysql> SHOW DATABASES;

CREATE TABLE example_database.todo_list (
mysql>     item_id INT AUTO_INCREMENT,
mysql>     content VARCHAR(255),
mysql>     PRIMARY KEY(item_id)
mysql> );
Insert a few rows of content in the test table. You might want to repeat the next command a few times, using different VALUES:

mysql> INSERT INTO example_database.todo_list (content) VALUES ("My first important item");
To confirm that the data was successfully saved to your table, run:

mysql>  SELECT * FROM example_database.todo_list;

nano /var/www/projectLEMP/todo_list.php

<?php
$user = "example_user";
$password = "password";
$database = "example_database";
$table = "todo_list";

try {
  $db = new PDO("mysql:host=localhost;dbname=$database", $user, $password);
  echo "<h2>TODO</h2><ol>";
  foreach($db->query("SELECT content FROM $table") as $row) {
    echo "<li>" . $row['content'] . "</li>";
  }
  echo "</ol>";
} catch (PDOException $e) {
    print "Error!: " . $e->getMessage() . "<br/>";
    die();
}
