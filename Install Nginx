1. All the steps remain the same . 

2. We just need to uninstall apache if its still there . 

Stop apache2.

 sudo service apache2 stop

$ sudo systemctl disable apache2

Uninstall Apache2 and its dependent packages.

sudo apt-get purge apache2 apache2-utils apache2.2-bin apache2-common
Use autoremove option to get rid of other dependencies.

 sudo apt-get autoremove
Check whether there are any configuration files that have not been removed.

whereis apache2
If you get a response as follows apache2: /etc/apache2 remove the directory and existing configuration files.

sudo rm -rf /etc/apache2  

If still while accessing the public IP we get apache2 page then follow the below page 

$ sudo apt-get remove apache2*
$ sudo apt-get autoremove
$ sudo apt-get autoclean
$ sudo rm -rf /etc/apache2 /var/lib/apache2 /var/lib/apache2


3. Install nginx 

First remove and flush the old apt repository cache then update the repository to load latest packages information and perform a full upgrade to upgrade all the installed packages.



$ sudo apt clean all && sudo apt update && sudo apt dist-upgrade


sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install nginx
sudo systemctl status nginx

4. so we need to add a rule to EC2 configuration to open inbound connection through port 80

5. Sample NGINX Configuration file is located at /etc/nginx/sites-available/example.com.conf

server {
listen 80;
server_name example.com www.example.com;
root /var/www/html;

location / {
try_files $uri $uri/ =404;
}
}

6. sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/example.com.conf /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/example.com.conf

In NGINX server blocks configuration files you will create the symbolic link using soft links between sites-available and sites-enabled directory. 
Soft links allows you whenever you will make changes to server blocks configuration file located in sites-available directory and it will immediately replicated to sites-enabled directory.

7. sudo nginx -t 

Check nginx syntax

8. If while accessing the public IP you are still recieving apache 2 check if index.html is still present

If it is still present then we need to remove the it
